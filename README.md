# The Traveling Tourist

This is a short, 1-week project for practice in representing graphs,
finding the shortest path (Dijkstra with a priority queue) between two tube stations
and solving the traveling salesman problem using simulated annealing.

The demo can be found at http://traveling-tourist.herokuapp.com
