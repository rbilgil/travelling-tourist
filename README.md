# The Traveling Tourist

This is a short 1-week project for practice in representing graphs,
finding the shortest path between two tube stations (Dijkstra with a priority queue)
and finding the optimum path between n points (Traveling salesman problem using simulated annealing).

I began by imagining being a tourist in London, wanting to visit certain places in one day, looking for the optimum route.

The demo can be found at http://traveling-tourist.herokuapp.com

The Foursquare API is used for place results, but the route finding is custom (not TFL).
